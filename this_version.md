# Changelog

v1.13.5:

- Classic-Burning Crusade support
- Package a community fork of LibRangeCheck with BC-Classic compatibility
- Prevented DogTag strings sometimes cutting off and showing "..." when they shouldn't if the user entered blank lines in the text box for the tags. Also changed the tooltip to not suggest pressing Enter since that could cause this problem. If you already have blank lines in your DogTag strings, you will want to remove them manually, but this fix prevents the problem from occurring in the future.
- Fixed custom buff/debuff bar tracking for targettarget units.
