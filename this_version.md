# Changelog

v1.13.3:

- Activated Totems module for all classes in Shadowlands. Some class abilities spawn units that live for a specific amount of time, and the game handles these as Totems.
- Fixed an issue where mana bars could use the wrong alpha settings if the player's maximum mana was 0 (such as during the use of Soulshape).
